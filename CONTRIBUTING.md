Guidelines for contributing
===========================

Our general goals for this manifesto include:

- Keep it simple! (KISS) This is our main principle. Avoid feature creep, avoid useless extra words.
- Keep politics out of the manifesto -- this is about people, not politics!
- The main manifesto must be one-page only. Separate documents to go further in details.
- Disseminate widely: Translations to new languages are welcome, sharing is essential!
- Simple markdown as basis: We will export documents to other formats as needed formats (HTML, PDF, etc.)
