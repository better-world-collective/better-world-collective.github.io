Manifesto for a better world
============================

Bail out people, not corporations
---------------------------------

If we give money to people to restart life, people will decide which companies get to live and which ones become extinct.

Focus on climate change
-----------------------

As we move forward, every step needs to reduce the damage we are doing to our environment.

Invest in healthcare and social services
----------------------------------------

The pandemic has exposed the weaknesses in our health care systems. Let us copy the systems that benefited people the most and replicate them across the globe.

Cooperation > Competition
-------------------------

Until now there has been too much emphasis on competition. We’re all in this together and we need to stop fighting each other and work together to take on the world’s problems.

Focus on sharing and leadership
-------------------------------

Improve your own life by helping others. Stop idolizing the rich; start dreaming about leading people to make the world a better place.

Treat people with care and respect
----------------------------------

Be mindful and work to ensure that all people have their basic needs covered. Respect workers and reward them fairly.

Demand transparency
-------------------

We need to weave transparency into all governments and public institutions. Without transparency we cannot ensure that governments and companies are following the law.
